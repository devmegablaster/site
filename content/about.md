# About Me

Hi, I’m Ojas Tyagi (“devmegablaster”), a software developer from India with a deep passion for technology and innovation. My journey in tech has been driven by a curiosity to explore how software can solve real-world problems and create meaningful impact. I’ve been fortunate to work on a variety of projects that have allowed me to develop a strong foundation in backend development, along with a growing interest in distributed systems and scalable architecture.

I spend a lot of my time experimenting with new technologies and frameworks, always eager to learn and apply something new. Whether it's building peer-to-peer networks or designing high-throughput, low-latency service-oriented architectures, I’m constantly pushing myself to improve and expand my skill set.

Beyond coding, I’m passionate about exploring new ideas and concepts, attending tech events, and engaging with the community. I also enjoy reading, traveling, and staying active through fitness. These interests keep me inspired and fuel my creativity, both in and out of the tech world.

Currently based in Bangalore, I’m part of the city’s vibrant tech community, where I’m always open to new opportunities and collaborations. If you’re in the area or just want to connect online, let’s chat. I’m always up for discussing projects, sharing ideas, or simply connecting with like-minded individuals. Feel free to reach out through my socials or drop me an email. Let’s see what we can build together!
