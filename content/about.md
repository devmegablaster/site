## 🚀 Hey, I’m Ojas Tyagi!

I’m a **programmer**, a problem solver (which _occasionally requires a computer_), and a curious explorer based in Bangalore, India. I love building things that _scale effortlessly_, _run fast_, and _make life a little smoother_. Whether it’s optimizing systems, tackling tricky bugs, or brainstorming wild ideas, I’m all about making things efficient, clean, and fun.

## ✨ What I Do

My work is about solving problems, building scalable systems, and creating tools that push boundaries. I’ve tackled challenges across scaling infrastructure, optimizing data pipelines, and crafting APIs that feel almost magical.

I previously worked at Superjoin, where I focused on scaling infrastructure, optimizing data workflows, and ensuring smooth integration processes. It was an awesome experience that taught me how to build robust systems and keep things running at scale.

I’m also fascinated by **aerospace** and engineering—growing up, I loved watching jets zooming through the sky up close. That fascination with speed, design, and engineering brilliance influences how I approach solving complex problems. My goal is to build systems that are fast, sleek, and efficient, much like a well-designed aerospace system.
